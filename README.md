HTML-enlight-project
====================
This is my personal branch of the HTML-enlight-project. As the project is on indefinite hiatus, I will only be updating this once in a blue moon for my own personal entertainment.

The ultimate goal is to create a web interface that is capable of controlling the Maquina Fountain using it's web api that both looks and performs professionally. 

The following is the content  of the original README.md

    Web page to control the Maquina fountain
